# About
We'll build a fitness tracker app that will help users log their workouts. They will input the date and type of workouts they have done for the day. These entries will be saved by date and organized in a list that the user can view. This fitness tracker app aims to help organize workout plans as well as track what workouts have been done for each day. The web app has a functionality that saves the user's workout entries into an activity calendar that darkens depending on the amount of entries have been made for the day.  The app's primary goal is to assist users log their workout history with ease as well as help track improvements.
